## Reporting Issues and Feature Requests

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the QualityCode Portals Tools app? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Clearly Identify the Issue and its Context

Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Can you list the steps you take to make it happen? What version of the app are you using?

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/TrentBrown/portals-quality-code/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/TrentBrown/portals-quality-code/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

The built-in tool for reporting an issue, which you can access by using `Report Issue` in the QualityCode Portals Tools app's Help menu, can help streamline this process by automatically providing the version of the QualityCode Portals Tools app, all your installed extensions, and your system info. Additionally, the tool will search among existing issues to see if a similar issue already exists.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of the QualityCode Portals Tools app

* Your operating system

* List of extensions that you have installed

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow. You can return to your issue page to see progress made.

# Thank You!
