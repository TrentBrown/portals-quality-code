## Reporting Issues and Feature Requests

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the QualityCode Portals Tools app? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Clearly Identify the Issue and its Context

Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Can you list the steps you take to make it happen? What version of the app are you using?

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/TrentBrown/portals-quality-code/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/TrentBrown/portals-quality-code/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

With each issue, please include as much of the following information as you can:

* Version of the QualityCode Portals Tools app. (find this at the upper right hand corner of the page.)

* Your operating system

* List of extensions that you have installed

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow. You can return to your issue page to see progress made.

# Thank You!
